I've recently read Kevin M. Gannon's "Radical Hope: A Teaching Manifesto," and really loved it.
It got me thinking more about teaching philosophy and how I want to approach teaching in the future.
This also lead me to read Maryellen Weimer's "Learner-Centered Teaching."
So I'm going to lay out a set of principles and explain each of them to flesh out my thoughts.

1. I am the ally of my students and learning is our mutual goal
1. Learner agency is essential to create free-thinking, self motivated students
1. Learning has value irregardless of it's career applicability
1. The most important thing I can teach is how to learn
1. Inclusivity uplifts us all
1. Teaching cannot be neutral politically

## I am the ally of my students and learning is our mutual goal
The wording from this principle and some others are pulled directly from Radical Hope.
This in some ways is basic, but in other ways is profound.
It's a statement of my basic purpose as a teacher, but also affirming that students are participants in the teaching process.

I am willing to use whatever methods are necessary to achieve this.
That means if a student struggles to attend class I will meet them where they are.
It means if a student has little time to study and do homework, I will understand and do whatever I can to help them understand the material.

I'm not the enemy of my student, there to challenge them with the hardest test problems, or catch them off guard with a quiz.
Rather, I'm there to help them get to the point that they can pass reasonable assessments.

## Learner agency is essential to create free-thinking, self motivated students
This one will be unfamiliar to many of us former students, having gone through a system that gives little to no agency to students.

Learner agency is about giving students choices for how they approach their education
That can be giving multiple assessment paths for the students to be graded and allowing the student to choose.
It can also be allowing the class to decide course expectations.
The idea is that we give some of the power we wield as teachers over to the students.
This creates an environment where students feel empowered, and thus creates motivation within them.

In addition, different students have different needs, thus a one-size-fits-all approach to teaching favors some students over others (usually leaving marginalized students out in the cold).
By giving students choices over their education, we can better accommodate all of our students.

## Learning has value irregardless of it's career applicability
In our modern university we are far too fixated on justifying how our class is valuable to the student's eventual ability to make money.
This is approach minimizes the liberatory effects of learning and critical thinking, the way a good education gives a person the freedom to make informed choices.
The joy of learning as well as the creativity new ideas fosters is also worthwhile independent of any economic benefits it may have.

## The most important thing I can teach is how to learn
I believe it is essential to cultivate good learners more than it is to teach specific technical skills.
Learning is a general toolkit involving humility about your current knowledge, the ability to take in new information, and the understanding of how to evaluate the new information as good.

In mathematics, this means seeing the logic and reason for a method.
Why does long division work?
What is the motivation behind a logarithm?

Other subjects of course have different (read worse) epistemologies than math.
In this subjects what is true is often unclear and up to interpretation.
Then teaching critical thinking and how to evaluate ideas becomes even more important than the teaching-them-a-bunch-of-facts approach to teaching.

In service of teaching them to learn, a teacher should not try to do all the learning work for the student.
Rather, they should at first model learning to the student, then allow the student to do that work for themselves.
So rather than just working examples on the board, they allow students to work examples.
Furthermore instead of giving all the examples to work on, they ask the students for examples.
The student must be an active participant in their learning, as in principle 2.

## Inclusivity uplifts us all
One might ask how this works.
Think of it like this.
The sidewalk cutouts were originally made to accommodate wheel chair users, yet we find they also help able-bodied people using carts.
Screenreader compliant documents helps visually impaired, but also allows students to listen to a reading while doing something else.
Likewise, ensuring students of all backgrounds have the ability to succeed in our classroom also enables the students with more typical backgrounds to succeed.

## Teaching cannot be neutral politically
This one is definitely controversial.
We think we can surely be neutral.
However, neutrality is simply accepting the status quo.
It is itself a political position, that everything is okay the way it is.

I believe teaching critical thinking is itself a political action.
Surely it favors some ideas over others, and thus some politics over others.
In addition being neutral is simply factually incorrect in many subjects.
Imagine a climate scientist refusing to teach about climate change because it wouldn't be neutral.
Ridiculous, yet we demand the same of so many teachers.

Moreover, the very participation of some of our students in society can be a political issue, one that I cannot be neutral on.

## Ending Thoughts
I'll likely revisit these ideas in the future, and reevaluate exactly what my principles are and what they mean.
I still have more books I want to read, but this seems good for now.
