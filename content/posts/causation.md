I was just wondering, what is causation?
Is it a single definite thing that defines existence?
Is it merely a mental approach we take, and not reflected in the basis of everything?
Are there multiple overlapping useful notions that we can consider?
Let's explore.

## Cause and Effect in Simulation

Let's look at cause and effect in a simpler universe, specifically Conway's Game of Life.
If you're not aware of Conway's Game of Life, go look it up somewhere else, I'm not explaining it here.

We can say that each generation causes the next.
So the second generation is caused by first, the third by the second and so on.
We can also say that the third generation is caused by the first.
Thus causation becomes a transitive relation between generations.

But it seems like we can extend causation to the specific cells in a generation.
The cells in a 3x3 can be said to cause the state of the centered cell in the next generation.
I think this is the most atomic form of causation you can identify in the game. 
Looking at few cells appears incomplete.
We can also extend this notion to stretch two generations by considering a 5x5 instead, and go on and on back into the generations.

So we find causation to be a transitive relationship of things determining each other through time.

## Cause and Effect Parallel to Time
Let's now consider what causation is when not being limited to a single timeline.
Specifically we consider how our actions setting up the simulation are outside the generations timeline that we were using to define causation.
We can definitely say that we cause the simulation with our actions.
This seems to me to be because we can establish a "happened before" relation between these things.
This relation is also transitive, but doesn't seem to be the same as causation.
Rather, it's necessary for A to have "happened before" B for A to have caused B.

## Self Causation and Whether Something Actually Happened
This "happened before" relation seems to usually form a partially ordered set.
Although it's easy to generalize to just a transitive relationship, in which case an event can cause itself.
I don't have a solid reason to not call such a thing causation.

Perhaps we can even see an example of this in the Game of Life.
If instead of identifying generations with their enumeration, we can do so with their state.
In which case the empty generation can be said to cause itself.
Many other patterns cause themselves after some number of generations.

Although here we have started viewing causation in a strange way.
Where we consider all generations that lead to a generation A to have caused generation A.
This can make sense in a multiverse where time forms a kind of directed graph, likely not acyclic, and every possible world exists.

This is strange and unintuitive, because not all we didn't walk every possible path that leads to now, we walked a specific one (at least we think we did).
This is definitely true for our Game of Life example, where we know what generation we started with, so we can find how we got to the now.
And further in a theoretical sense we might formalize the game as a sequence of generations that all lead to each other.
So then a generation only happened in our game if we can find it in this sequence prior to the now.
We are then distinguishing between something actually happening, and something that would lead to the now if it had happened.

## So, What has Actually Happened?
Um, uh, this is getting existential, but we've arrived at something similar to Last Thursdayism.
Where we don't know if the remembered past happened, or some other past that would lead to the now, or if our timeline has just begun last Thursday.
We don't have the analogous sequence of generations, some record independent of the timeline that tells us exactly what happened.
Instead we just have our memories.
Thus whether or not we have this many independent pasts causing one now, or one singular true past is unknowable to us, without somehow accessing a world outside our time.

We might also note that on an A theory of time it's not possible for the true past to known, as the past doesn't exist and as such it cannot possibly be verified whether it happened or not.
In fact on an A theory of time we might question if there even is a true past.

## Where from here?
This was a very interesting thought experiment.
I feel I've learned more about causation, not everything I wondered about in the intro, but fascinating stuff nonetheless.
