So a lot of stuff happened this year for me, and I want to go over some of it.

## Autism Diagnosis 
This year I was diagnosed with autism and ADHD. Really explains a lot about me. Idk what else to say.

## D&D
Me and my siblings had been playing D&D for a year or so. 
This August we started a new campaign set in the city of Ptolus. 
I'm playing a half-elf cleric that's obsessed with a particular saint and preaches her message at every opportunity. 
Low charisma means I'm not very good at the preaching though.
    
## Meds
Been trying some meds for a while, but finally got it right 
Since about 2021 I've been on and off of antidepressants (wasn't supposed to be off them at all but ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è) but near the beginning of this year I got on some meds that really work. 
Like I could get out of bed in the mornings and wanted to do stuff. 
This is pretty huge because it meant I could start really looking for jobs and my grad school applications (more on that later).

## Coming Out
Around this June, I decided to finally do it, come out to my family. 
I'd been out to some of my siblings for a while, but finally came out to the rest and my parents. 
Went pretty well overall. 
Didn't get disowned or anything so I'd call it a win.

This also kicked off me getting laser hair removal on my face, and my process of legal transition. 
Still working on my name change, but it'll go faster once that's done.

## Grad School 
I'm applying to graduate programs for mathematics!
Hoping to get into a PhD program.
My grades aren't the best, but are probably(?) good enough.
And I wrote what I think was a really good personal statement.
Hopefully it's enough.

## Mod Pack Project
I'm making a minecraft mod pack!
Specifically one inspired by Gregtech: New Horizons.
Mine however with be in version 1.20.1 (GTNH is in 1.7).
I'm excited about it, currently testing mods to figure out what exactly I want to include.

## Work
Got a job doing retail.
Kinda sucks, but I do like money.
Not that bad.

## books/essays I've read 
I've read some this year, less than I'd like, but still feel alright about it.
I'm going to mention all the books I've read, and some essays that stuck with me.

### Math Books
I'm a nerd and read math textbooks on my own time (although I've only gotten through the one this year).

#### Graph Theory and its Applications 
I liked this textbook, learned a lot.
I read almost the whole thing, maybe skipping one section, and enjoyed everything I learned.
Seems like a good choice if you want to learn introductory graph theory.

### Pedagogy 
I want to be a teacher, so have asked my advisor for things to read on pedagogy, these are the one's I've gotten through so far.

#### First Order Principles for College Teachers
First one I read.
I liked it a fair amount, good advice in it.
A lot of thought about stopping at the right time, taking pauses, waiting.
It's got a good philosophy for getting to work on things, and not rushing just before the deadline.
Basically it says for writing that you should do an outline, and work on it for maybe ten minutes a day, but consistently and early.
After those few minute, you stop.
Don't fall into the urge to spend a ton of time on it.
(Of course eventually you'll increase the length of your sessions to finish it up, but early on keep them short.)
I used this process for writing my personal statement for applying to grad school, and it worked really well.

There's more in the book, and I'll probably come back to it in the future.

#### Radical Hope: A Teaching Manifesto
Wonderful wonderful wonderful book!
This book gives wonderful perspective on things like the purpose of teaching, inclusion, the unspoken messages we send our students, student agency, and a few others.
This heavily influenced my teaching philosophy (as I detailed in [this post]({{< ref "/posts/babys-first-teaching-philosophy.md" >}})).
It also reference another book, namely

#### Learner Centered Teaching 
This was also excellent, and also influenced that post.
It questions the typical role of the teacher, just as a person that rules the classroom and dispenses knowledge, and replaces it with a role of guiding students through their own learning journey, giving them power over it.
Additionally it advocates prioritizing developing student critical thinking skills above just covering content.
Again, see the other post if you want more.

#### A Mathematician's Lament 
Loved this book.
It's mostly geared towards k-12 education though, but I do think college level teachers can learn from it some.
Also we can advocate for better k-12 math education.
It's also just a fascinating read, and just might be the antidote to adult's math trauma.
Highly recommend reading it.

### transfeminism 
So this year I've gotten into learning about transfeminist theory.
I should really pick up a copy of Whipping Girl, but for now I've just been reading essays online.
I've read more than this, but these are the two that stood out to me.

#### The Third Sex (Talia Bhatt)
This is a very interesting essay.
She discusses the way western academics have mysticized gender minorities in other cultures, when reading them as analogous to trans people makes much more sense.
These academics understand these as third genders, with little regard for their oppression.
She then discusses third gendering in western cultures, and how a third gender doesn't shake patriarchy or male supremacy at all, just gives them a dumping ground for the freaks.
I don't know, was very interesting to me.

#### Cry Like A Fag, Scream Like A Woman (Lee Cicuta)
This essay is a bit of a response to calls from left leaning people for the left to make room for men, market itself to men, etc.
It's thesis is that cis men need to be prepared to loose the respect and privileges afforded to them by patriarch in order to be allies to women and other gender marginalized folk.
It understands men's right leaning tendencies to be because the right pushes for patriarchcal power, whereas the left (nominally) opposes it.
Essentially marketing ourselves to men risks compromising our feminist principles.
I think this work is essential to anyone discussing the current state of men in politics.
