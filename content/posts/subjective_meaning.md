+++

Was just pacing the kitchen, thinking about stuff relating to atheism, and has some thoughts.

## There is no such thing as objective meaning.
I'm just going to state this, not argue for it.
It seems self evident to me.
Things can only be meaningful to someone, not meaningful in the abstract.
You personally care about something or you don't, depending on your own psychology.
Some external something declaring things meaningful has no bearing on that.

## The relation of this to Nihilism
So here I'm using Nihilism to refer to the idea that life is meaningless, or not worth living more accurately.

And there's two angles I think you can come at this from, the objective one and the subjective human lens.

### Objectively
Nothing is objectively more meaningful than anything else.
Objectively, living forever with God in the heavens is no better than the true oblivion that actually awaits us after death.
This is trivially true because of there being no objective meaning, but it comes to the point I was thinking about.

There could be a mind that finds being exalted and communing with the most high to be the most meaningless, worthless fate imaginable, and finds comfort in oblivion.
Nothing bars this from being the case.

It raises the question, why do people tend to find one more meaningful than the other?

### Subjectively from a Human point of view
I can't answer this definitively.
Just that perhaps culturally, or even inherently, we are uncomfortable with the idea that everything we've ever created will pass away.
For some reason we want our accomplishments to stretch on into eternity.

I wonder, what exactly about this is meaningful to us?
If you had an inscription dedicated to you that would somehow last forever, would that ease this fear?
Even if there was no one to read it, would it be worthwhile?
I personally wouldn't find that very meaningful.

Perhaps if people remembered you in some way forever that would be more comforting?
This does seem more comfortable to me.
That something of my story or accomplishments was passed down to future generations.
Seems like something worth doing.

This makes me wonder though, does it have to go on forever to achieve that?
If your achievements were remembered for a couple thousand years, would that be comparable?
Honestly I'm still at least somewhat comforted by this, but not very comforted by the idea of being remembered for a few short generations.
Does the time scale matter here?

Does it matter if the people that remember you are human?
Does the idea of an alien species finding records of our civilization give you more peace?
I still like this idea.

### Conclusion
I don't really know, I kinda petered out there.
I guess I at least do have some desire to be remembered beyond my death.
I don't think it's everything, my life was still worthwhile if I'm not remembered.
As long as I enjoyed my time and helped others enjoy their time.
